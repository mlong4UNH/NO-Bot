# NO-Bot
A repository to store the source code for the Twitter and Facebook code. 
Written in Python 2.7 by Michael Long for the express purpose of aiding the position of secretary within Kappa Kappa Psi.
Started on April 10th, 2018 for the purpose of increasing communication between the Nu Omicron Chapter and its members.

- The current objectives are to improve the Secretaries efficiency in aiding communication efforts and increase prescence on social media.

The scope is currently limited to:
1. A weekly post regarding relevant events happening that week: Co-Sponserships, Fundraising, Service, and Band events.
2. A daily post to remind brothers of things happening on a given day.
3. Retrieving information from meeting minute documents so that the secretary does not need to post several places with the same information.

With these methods we hope to achieve stronger communication skills with brothers on social media and improve attendance at events with a longer notice.

Two Projects for separate social medias are contained and will eventually have instruction manuals for set up, operation and matinence.
                                      
                                      Please review the release for future use.
