Written in Python 2.7 by Michael Long, the fall 2018 - spring 2019 Secretary for Nu-Omicron chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi.

Last Updated on April 19th 2018

Written the express purpose of aiding the position of secretary within Kappa Kappa Psi by automating weekly event handling, meeting minutes handling, and also increasing social media presence to remind brothers of upcoming events.

Objectives of this python script:
1. A weekly post regarding relevant events happening that week: Co-Sponsorships, Fundraising, Service, and Band events.
2. A daily post to twitter to remind brothers of things happening on a given day.
3. Retrieving information from meeting minute documents so that the secretary does not need to post several places with the same information.
4. Preparing and sending a formatted meeting minutes email, even further simplifying the secretary position.

With these methods we hope to achieve stronger communication skills with brothers on social media and improve attendance at events with a longer notice, as well as reducing the overall workload done by the secretary.
